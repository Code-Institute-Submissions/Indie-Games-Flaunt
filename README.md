# Indie Games Flaunt

A website where indie game developers can share their games.

**Terms:**

**flaunt (verb)** - display (something) ostentatiously, especially in order to provoke envy or admiration or to show defiance.

**Indie game**s are video games, commonly created by individuals or small teams of video game developers and usually without significant financial support of a video game publisher or other outside source.

Indie games are mostly found on dedicated websites that cater to the needs of developers as opposed to casual users. These sites (usually forums) are aimed at computer savvy individuals and as such can be off putting to more casual users - the interfaces can be difficult to navigate and can be difficult to use on mobile devices. This website attempts to give developers a place to share their games and collaborate with developers whilst at the same time catering to casual gamers. The user interface should be computer game themed but easy to navigate on mobile as well as desktop computers. There should be an admin section specifically for the website provider that allows removal of offensive content and modification of posts/broken links etc.
 
## UX

**External users goal:**
A casual game player can browse the site and download a game they wish to play.

**External users goal:**
A game developer can share their game and make contact with other developers.

**Site owners goal:**
Promote indie game development be providing a website where developers have access to an audience as well as a community of potential collaborators.
 
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

**Dedicated game screen**

Here we see a mock up of what the user will see if they were to click on a particular game. The game's title is displayed in large letters along with a large screenshot.  A textual description of the game is displayed alongside another screenshot. The developers name is provided (this is also a link that points to all of the developers other games). The link to the game is provided at the bottom of the page. Not shown in this wireframe is functioality to share a particular game to a social media feed such as Facebook and Twitter etc.

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature idea

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment


This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.

## Local deployment / development ##

## Internet Deployment / web hosting ##

**Setting up the database**

full path to db was used during development, env variable was used for deployment to keep database secure.

**more info**

do i need IP 0.0.0.0 and PORT 5000?

added gunicorn to python

added gunicord to procfile

(need more info on gunicorn)

commited to github

to deploy to heroku:

created an account with heroku
created a new heroku app

linked heroku app with github repository

set heroku to automaticall update the app whenever github repositor was updated

The Heroku service was used to deploy the website online. An account with Heroku was created using the free tier.

An app was then initialised on Heroku called "indie-games-flaunt". The settings were left at their default values for this app.

A web server was added to the development machines Python setup called gunicorn.

The procfile was created that contained information about the web server.

Add info about Procfile requirements

The requirements.txt file was added. This containes information needed to allow the webserver to know what dependencies the app needs. pip3 flask >require,ents.txt

Make a commit to github. In this case the repository was called Indie-Games-Flaunt. In heroku, in the deployment settings for the indie-games-flaunt app, deployment method was set to link to the Indie-Games-Flaunt repository.

From Heroku, the app can be set to automaticall update whenever a new commit is made, but for development of this app, manual update was selected. This allowed better control for troubleshooting purposes.

Again from the deploy tab in heroku, the app can then be built by pressing the deploy branch button. After the app builds, clicking the open app button will reveal the URL of the website, allowing it to be opened on any device with internet acsess.

## Credits

### Content
- The text for section Y was copied from the [Wikipedia article Z](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z)

### Media
- The photos used in this site were obtained from ...

### Acknowledgements

- I received inspiration for this project from X

### Rough work for readme

Potential features to include:

Admin section (perhaps use Materialize for this). Admin section allows deletion of posts, edit of posts (in case of broken link etc)
Developer can make a post about a game which includes: Some screenshots, some text describing the game, link to game, contact details of the developer.
Casual game players can browse games by category (Action, puzzle, sports, educational, popularity (see thumbs up), creator etc)
Report a post for offensive content or broken link etc
"Thumbs up" button that users can click. Each thumbs up accumulates giving an indication of the games popularity

Advanced potential feature (nice-to-have):

Select a random game
Host the actual game file as opposed to an external link
Button to share the game details on social media

Look / color scheme / theme:

Each game post should have a standard structure. There should be a fixed number of screenshots provided and a limit on the amount of text available to describe the game. These limits will help create a consistent look to the site. Ideally, all of the information about a game should be available without much scrolling.
Use a font and color pallette from an old school video game console such as the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES).
Details about the bootstrap theme/template chosen

Questions for Spencer:

Using Bootstrap & Materialize at the same time, good or bad idea? Should the Materialize style compliment the Bootstrap style?
